                This is especially important for debugging. In this lab, Jupyter Lab and Arduino were used in tandem to establish a bluetooth connection.

                    <h3>Prelab</h3>
                    <p>
                        To start the lab, I needed to create a virtual environment. 
                        As I already had the latest version of python, I just had to install pip and create my virtual environment from there.
                        Then, I installed the codebase which would allow me to use ArduinoBLE. BLE, or "Bluetooth Low Energy" is a version of Bluetooth
                        optimized for situations that don't require large sets of data transfer. The file ble_arduino.ino was the main file being used in this
                        lab on the Artemis side. On the computer side, Jupyter Notebooks was used. For the virtual environment setup, I used the following code:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
                                python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        From there, I created a folder in my computer where all my Fast Robots code, and the fast robots environment would be kept, and then activated it.
                        After this, I opened Juputer Lab.
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                > .\FastRobots_ble\Scripts\activate
                                > jupyter lab
                            </code> 
                        </pre>  
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Configuration</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to establish a bluetooth connection, I needed to know my device's MAC address. I did this by having it print to the serial monitor.
                        Alongside this, I generated a UUID, or Unique Universal Identifier for my specific board such that I wouldn't connect to another student's board
                        by mistake. All the info was added to the connections.yaml file in the demo codebase.
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                artemis_address: 'c0:89:94:6d:0e:4b'

                        </pre>
                        Initially, I had a lot of trouble connecting to bluetooth. However, it was as simple as adding an extra
                        character to my artemis_address. The serial monitor had printed c0:89:94:6d:e:6b. However, the python script needed 12 characters,
                        so I added a 0 to get an equivalent 12 character MAC address.

                        It is important for the Artemis Board to be able to send and modify strings. In order to configure this, I created a function ECHO.
                        On the Arduino side, this consisted of adding a prefix to the message to say "Robot says ->" followed by the original message.

                        Rather than send this data to over bluetooth live, instead a full dataset was collected for 5 seconds and 
                        essentially sent in bulk.
                        Initially, I created an array with 5000 indexes, or one message per second. Upon actually running the loop, this array 
                        filled up very quickly, meaning messages could be stored much faster than that. Only 1 or 2 of the 5 seconds were even recorded.
                        In future iterations, specifically when temperature and time were sent at the same time, I added a delay to remedy this.

                        Similar to the previous task, I now was sending time and temperature data simultaneously. Each was stored in a separate global array.
                        These global arrays were stored at the very top of the ble_arduino.ino function, such that any case would be able to access them.

                    <p>
                        In order to actually record data over 5 seconds, I needed to introduce a delay to my data collection.
                        With no delay, 1000 data points were filled up in under a second, though the exact time is unknown.
                        When I added a delay of 20 ms between every collected data point, only 250 data points were needed to capture 5 seconds,
                        meaning 50 datapoints a second.

                    <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Method</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each method of sending data has its own pros and cons. The first method of sending datapoints
                        live is very "quick" in the moment. For very short operations it may be beneficial to be able to
                        watch the measurements live, especially in a case where debugging is needed. However, this method
                        essentially clips the data, because the bluetooth connections can only send datapoints so fast. For
                        steady state cases, say if the robot is just driving straight without turns, this does not matter much.
                        However for complex motions this data clipping is a disadvantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In comparison, the array method of sending data was incredibly fast. I was able to store at a rate faster 
                        than one timestamp per second, implying a very fast data transfer rate. In addition to this, it was very fast to
                        send and process the data array using the notification handler. It would be useful to collect data this way
                        for something like a stunt, and be able to process the success of an operation after it is completed and be able to
                        optimize it from there.

                        This begs the question of, when will the Artemis literally run out of data? The Artemis has 384 kB of RAM. If every
                        float takes up 4 bytes of RAM, then 96,000 datapoints can be stored before memory runs out. If we are recording
                        both time and temperature, this is 48,000 datapoints per measurement. However, each string also takes up a certain number of
                        bytes per character. This means even less data can be sent to the notification handler before storage runs out.
                        In comparison, sampling at a specific frequency could be much faster. If we transmit 16-bit pieces of data at a rate of
                        150 Hz, then over 6 seconds, 1500 bytes will be used. Dividing 384 kb by 1500 means 256 5 second intervals of data can be
                        sent before storage runs out!

                    <p>Bluetooth communication will be extremely useful in future labs for communication between the bot and
                        my computer. I imagine this will be useful for feedback loops, for example. This lab also made me more 
                        comfortable with Jupyter Labs.
