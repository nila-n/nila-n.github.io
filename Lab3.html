            <p class="mb-5">The purpose of this lab was to configure our TOF (Time-of-Flight) sensors, which are intended for measuring distances.
                 We also began soldering components to the Artemis and began planning our future wiring.

                    <h3>Prelab</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before beginning the lab, we first considering how we would wire the entire robot. This included the IMU, 2 TOF sensors,
                        and 2 motor drivers alongside the batteries and QWIIC connect. A wiring diagram is shown below. 

                        <img src="images/TOF/circuit diagram-23.jpg" alt = "circuit diagram" width=80% />

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By default, the two TOF sensors will have the same I2C address. This means, unless this address is artificially changed, even if both sensors 
                        were wired to the QWIIC connect, only one would measure any data. To aid this, we will be using the XSHUT pin on one of the 
                        sensors to be able to configure our void setup() function accordingly. The plan is to first record the default address of the sensor, 
                        and then shut down power to it and manually change its address such that when the second sensor initializes afterwards, its 
                        address will be unique. The first default address is shown below, and represents the number 84 but bit shifted.

                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Regarding TOF sensor placement, I think it would be useful to have the sensors be perpendicular to each other. 
                        That is, have one on the front of the robot and one on either the right or left side. I believe this will be useful once we 
                        begin path planning and object detection to be able to see things not only in front of the robot, but to the side as well.

                    <p>
                        We needed to solder a connector to the battery, and also solder the QWIIC connect wires to the TOF sensors.
                        For the XShutdown pin, I only soldered that port on one of the sensors, as only one address needs to change.
                        I chose the longer wires for the TOF sensors, since the IMU exact position matters less.

                    <p>
                        As discussed in the pre-lab, I only soldered the XShut pin of one of the TOF sensors. I wired mine to pin 2 on the Artemis, 
                        and I switched between HIGH and LOW to turn the first TOF off, change it's address, and then turn it back on. The code for this 
                        is shown below. In this setup function, I also decided to use the shortest distance mode for later tests of precision and accuracy.

                            digitalWrite(SHUTDOWN_PIN,0);

                            distanceSensor1.init();

                            //Shut down first sensor, change address
                            distanceSensor1.setI2CAddress(0x54);

                            if (distanceSensor1.begin() != 0) //Begin returns 0 on a good init
                            {

                                ;
                            }
                            Serial.println("Sensor 1 online!");

                    <p>
                        With the two sensors wired up, I then focused on testing them. I set the distance mode to short, which measures a maximum of
                        1.3 meters at a max sampling rate of 50 Hz. I taped the TOF sensors to my laptop in a flat orientation, and used a tape measure to 
                        set up set distances from a wall. At each distance, I measured 100 data points with the intention of finding the mean and standard deviation 
                        at each distance. I then used the mean to determine a rough accuracy at each distance, while standard deviation told me more about 
                        the sensor's precision/repeatability.

                        The code snippet below shows how data was measured. Afterwards, it was sent via bluetooth using the same method as past labs.

                                distanceSensor2.startRanging();

                                clear();

                                int startT = millis();
                                int i = 0;
                                int j = 0;
                                while(i < NUM_DATA_POINTS && j < NUM_DATA_POINTS){
                                    time_data[i] = millis(); //normalized time

                                    Serial.println(time_data[i]);

                                    if (distanceSensor1.checkForDataReady()) {

                    <p>
                        Based on this experiment, I noticed a few things about sensor performance. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>At far away distances (24 inches or 2 feet) both sensors lacked reliability, with standard deviations of 
                                around 10 mm (1 cm). In comparison, at all other distances the  standard deviation value was 1.5mm or less. </li>
                            <li>At distances under 1-2 inches (50.8 mm), data was fairly unreliable. One of my TOF sensors consistently just 
                                read 0 mm under 1 inch, and the other had a standard deviation of 1-1.5mm, however that is now a much 
                                larger percentage of the true value.
                            </li>
                            <li>The two sensors were consistently a few mm off from each other, however this may just be due to a non-robust 
                                setup (as in, they were just taped to my laptop).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
